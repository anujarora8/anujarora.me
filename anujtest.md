<h1> Pre-Authenticated Users In Ada </h1>

<p> This article will outline how to implement Adaâ€™s [Authentication](https://adasupporthelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017971094-Authentication) functionality for your customers who are already logged in to your services on either a webpage, desktop application, or mobile application. Once enabled, a user who is already logged in to their account on your website, mobile app, or desktop app, will not be asked by the bot to log in again mid-conversation. </p>

<p> The core difference between this article and the original Authentication article is that this version does not leverage the Sign In blocks. Instead, this method of authentication relies on some simple Auth Token and/or Session ID generation.
